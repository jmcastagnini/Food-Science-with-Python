    "# Response surface methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying the RSM methodology, it is first necessary to choose an experimental design that will define which experiments should be carried out in the experimental region being studied.\n",
    "Experimental designs for first-order models (e.g., factorial designs) can be used when the data set does not present curvature [3]. However, to approximate a response function to experimental data that cannot be described by linear functions, experimental designs\n",
    "for quadratic response surfaces should be used, such as three-level factorial, Box–Behnken, central composite, and Doehlert designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stages in the application of RSM as an optimization technique:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The selection of independent variables of major effects on the system through screening studies and the delimitation of the experimental region, according to the objective of the study and the experience of the researcher;\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The choice of the experimental design and carrying out the experiments according to the selected experimental matrix;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The mathematic–statistical treatment of the obtained experimental data through the fit of a polynomial function;\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The evaluation of the model’s fitness;\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The verification of the necessity and possibility of performing a displacement in direction to the optimal region;\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Obtaining the optimum values for each studied\n",
    "variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The experimental design\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest model which can be used in RSM is based on a linear function. Therefore, the responses should not present any curvature. In this case, Two-level factorial designs are used in the estimation of first-order effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate curvature, a second-order model must be used. In this case, a central point in two-level factorial designs can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next level of the polynomial model should contain additional terms, which describe the interaction between the different experimental variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine a critical point (maximum, minimum, or saddle), it is necessary for the polynomial function to contain quadratic terms. In this case, the experimental design has to assure that all studied variables are carried out at in at\n",
    "least three factor levels. Among the more known second-order symmetrical designs are the three-level factorial design, Box–Behnken design, central composite design, and Doehlert design. These symmetrical designs differ from one another with\n",
    "respect to their selection of experimental points, number of levels for variables, and number of runs and blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Codification of the levels of the variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Codification of the levels of the variable consists of transforming each studied real value into coordinates inside a scale with dimensionless values, which must be proportional at its localization in the\n",
    "experimental space. Codification is of concern because it enables the investigation of variables of different orders of magnitude without the greater influencing the evaluation of the lesser.\n",
    "The following equation can be applied to transform a real value ($z_i$) into a coded value ($x_i$) according to a determinate experimental design:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_i = \\left( \\frac{z_i − z^0_i}{\\Delta z_i} \\right) \\beta_d $\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z_i$ is the distance between the real value in the central point and the real value in the superior or inferior level of a variable, $\\beta_d$ is the major coded limit value in the matrix for each variable, and $z_0$ is the real value in the central point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation of the fitted model\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, a model will be well fitted to the experimental data if it presents a significant regression and a non-significant lack of fit (to apply a lack of fit test, the experimental design must be performed with authentic repetitions at least in its central point). In other words, the major part of variation observation must be described by the equation of regression, and the remainder of the variation will certainly be due to the residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full three-level factorial design\n",
    "\n",
    "Full three-level factorial design is an experimental matrix that has limited application in RSM when the factor number is higher than 2 because the number of experiments required for this design (calculated by expression $N = 3^k$, where N is experiment number and k is factor number) is very large, thereby losing its efficiency in the modeling of quadratic functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a complete three-level factorial design for more than two variables requires more experimental runs than can usually be accommodated in practice, designs that present a smaller number of experimental points, such as the Box–Behnken, central composite, and Doehlert designs, are more often used [11]. However, for two variables, the efficiency is comparable with designs such as central composite.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Box–Behnken designs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    All factor levels have to be adjusted only at three levels (−1, 0, +1) with equally spaced intervals between these levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Central composite design:\n",
    "\n",
    "    All factors are studied in five levels ($− \\alpha$, −1, 0, +1, $+ \\alpha$)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Doehlert design\n",
    "\n",
    "    - each variable is studied at a different number of levels, a particularly important characteristic when some variables are subject to restrictions such as cost and/or instrumental constraints or when it is interesting to study a variable at a major or minor\n",
    "number of levels;\n",
    "    - the intervals between its levels present a uniform distribution;\n",
    "    - displacement of the experimental matrix to another experimental region can be achieved using previous adjacent points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple responses optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "An approach for solving the problem of the optimization of several responses is the use of a multicriteria methodology. This methodology is applied when various responses have to be considered at the same time and it is necessary to find optimal\n",
    "compromises between the total numbers of responses taken into account. The Derringer function or desirability function [20] is the most important and most currently used multicriteria methodology in the optimization of analytical procedures. This methodology is initially based on constructing a desirability function for each individual response. In summary, the measured properties related to each response are transformed into a dimensionless individual desirability (di) scale. Through the individual functions, the analyst introduces the specifications that each response must fulfill in the\n",
    "measuring procedure. The scale of the individual desirability function ranges between d = 0, for a completely undesirable response, and d = 1, for a fully desired response, above which further improve-\n",
    "ments would have no importance. This transformation makes it possible to combine the results obtained for properties measured on different orders of magnitude.\n",
    "With the individual desirabilities, it is then possible to obtain the overall desirability (D). The overall desirability function D is defined as the weighted geometric average of the individual desirability (di).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Artificial neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) offer an attractive possibility for providing non-linear modeling for response surfaces and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neurons are arranged in a series of layers: one\n",
    "input layer with neurons representing independent variables, one output layer with neurons representing dependent variables, and several hidden layers that associate the inputs with outputs. Each neuron from one layer is connected with each neuron in the next layer. Data generated from the experimental design can be used as relevant inputs, as well as outputs, for ANN training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training is carried out by adjusting the strength of connections between neurons with the aim to adapt the outputs of the entire network to be closer to the desired outputs or to minimize the sum of the training data. During the training phase, each neu-\n",
    "ron receives the input signals $x_i$ from n neurons, aggregates them by using the weights ($w_{ij}$) of the synapses, and passes the result after suitable transformation as the output signal $y_i$ (Fig. 6(b)) as a function of the sum, according to Eq. (20):\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y_i = f \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_iw_{ij} \\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where f is the transfer function that is necessary to transform the weighted sum of all the signals connecting with a neuron. The most widely used transfer function is presented in Eq. (21):\n",
    "\n",
    "$f = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-cx}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where c is a constant that determines the slope of the sigmoid function.\n",
    "The training phase is finished when the square error is minimized across all training experiments. Once ANN has been trained, it has a good predictive capability and ability to accurately describe\n",
    "the response surface even without any knowledge about the physical and chemical background of the modeled system [14,22].\n",
    "ANN offers an alternative to the polynomial regression method as a modeling tool. Classical RSM requires the specification of a polynomial function such as linear, first-order interaction, or second-order quadratic, to be regressed. Moreover, the number of terms in the polynomial is limited to the number of experimental design points, and the selection of the appropriate polynomial equation can be extremely cumbersome because each response requires its own individual polynomial equation.\n",
    "The ANN methodology provides the modeling of complex relationships, especially non-linear ones, that may be investigated without complicated equations. ANN analysis is quite flexible in regards to the number and form of the experimental data, which makes it possible to use more informal experimental designs than with statistical approaches. Also, neural network models might have better predictive power than regression models. Regression analyses are dependent on predetermined statistical significance\n",
    "levels, and less significant terms are usually not included in the model. With the ANN method, all data are used, potentially making the models more accurate [82].\n",
